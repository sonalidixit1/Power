I've developed an interactive dashboard that measures the sales performance of our beauty store for the year 2023-2024 (till date). This dashboard leverages key KPIs to provide valuable insights and drive data-informed decisions.

Key Features:
Top 3 Performers: Highlighting our top sales team members.
Monthly Sales Trend: Visualizing sales growth and patterns over time.
Total Sales: Monitoring our overall revenue in real-time.
Average Order Value (AOV): Tracking the average spending per transaction.
Number of Products Sold: Analyzing sales performance for each product.
New vs. Returning Customers: Understanding customer loyalty and behavior.
Technologies Used:
Power BI: For creating dynamic and visually appealing dashboards.
DAX: For advanced data modeling and calculations.
MySQL: For managing and querying data efficiently.
This dashboard empowers Beauty Bliss to make informed decisions, optimize our sales strategies,
and recognize the efforts of our top performers.
